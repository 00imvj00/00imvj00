# why?

Each specialist sees something different.By default,

- a typical Engineer will think in systems
- a psychologist will think in terms of incentives
- a biologist will think in terms of evolution

By putting these disciplines together in our head,
we can walk around a problem in a three dimensional way.
If we’re only looking at the problem one way, we’ve got a blind spot. And blind spots can kill you.
