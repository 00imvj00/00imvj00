# why?

Each specialist sees something different.By default,

- a typical Engineer will think in systems
- a psychologist will think in terms of incentives
- a biologist will think in terms of evolution

By putting these disciplines together in our head,
we can walk around a problem in a three dimensional way.
If we’re only looking at the problem one way, we’ve got a blind spot. And blind spots can kill you.

Here’s another way to think about it. When a botanist looks at a forest they may focus on the ecosystem, an environmentalist sees the impact of climate change, a forestry engineer the state of the tree growth, a business person the value of the land. None are wrong, but neither are any of them able to describe the full scope of the forest. Sharing knowledge, or learning the basics of the other disciplines, would lead to a more well-rounded understanding that would allow for better initial decisions about managing the forest. **we need to work on our latticework**

Building your latticework is a lifelong project. Stick with it, and you’ll find that your ability to understand reality, make consistently good decisions, and help those you love will always be improving.
