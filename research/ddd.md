1. First Principles.
2. Genuinely care about the problem.
3. Learn and deeply understand the problem domain.
4. Fall in love with the problem, not the technology.
5. Software design is all about taking an educated guess at the future with the help of absractions and interfaces.
6. Keep in mind, software and business requirements changes overtime.
7. Learn to understand,
    - **known knowns (the things we do know)**
    - **known unknowns (things we know, that we don't know)**
    - **unknown unknowns (things we don't know that we don't know)**

8. keep an eye out for essencial **system quality attributes**.
9. SQAs are going to signal you, what is important in the system and what is not.
10. Realistically understanding that **we can't be good at everything right off the bat**, depending on what the system is supposed to do, **only some of these are critically system quality attributes essential**. Identifying those will help us make some of those big up-front decisions. That's what architecture is about.
11. Planning is almost everything.
